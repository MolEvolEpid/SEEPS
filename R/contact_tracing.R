# Contact tracing functionality for generating samples correlation
#
# Users provide a discovery rate function that describes the information obtained
# from a contact tracing interview. The function is used to accept or reject
# new detections, new detections are iteratively contact traced until a termination
# condition is reached, or we run out of new detections to trace.
